# Introduction

For this assignment, we developed a machine learning model to predict the vertices that should serve as the sources.

# Train
## Target creation
```
python 01_net2min.py
```

## Feature engineering
Many features were generated by considering the distances between vertices. To enhance the robustness of the machine learning model, various augmentations were also implemented.
```
python 02_augmentation.py
```

## Modelling
```
python 03_train.py
```

# Inference
```
python inference.py
```
