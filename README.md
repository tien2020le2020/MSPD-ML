# Introduction

This repository presents the 3rd place solution for the MSPD Machine Learning [Contest](https://github.com/TILOS-AI-Institute/Multi-Source-Prim-Dijkstra/tree/main/contest).

The approach is purely based on AI. A machine learning model is built to predict the vertices that should serve as the sources.

# Train
## Target creation
```
python 01_net2min.py
```

## Feature engineering
Many features were generated by considering the distances between vertices. To enhance the robustness of the machine learning model, various augmentations were also implemented.
```
python 02_augmentation.py
```

## Modelling
```
python 03_train.py
```

# Inference
```
python inference.py
```
